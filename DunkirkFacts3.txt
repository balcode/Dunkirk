It was named after the dynamo room in the Dover cliffs where their operation HQ was based.

4. “Nothing but a miracle can save the BEF now,” said General Alan Brooke.

5. Initially it was estimated that just 45,000 men could be evacuated in 48 hours. Instead the operation was to become the biggest evacuation in military history.

6. A call was sent out for as many naval vessels as possible to help the Royal Navy – including small craft that could get close to the waiting soldiers in the shallow waters.

7. British civilians responded in their droves with everything from private yachts, motor launches, lifeboats, paddle steamers and barges joining the effort.

The craft came from as far away as the Isle of Man.  

8. The smallest boat to take part was the Tamzine, a 14ft open-topped fi shing boat, now in the Imperial War Museum.

9. On the eve of the operation a national day of prayer was declared with King George VI attending a special service in Westminster Abbey.

10. The evacuation began on May 27. Just 8,000 soldierswere rescued.
